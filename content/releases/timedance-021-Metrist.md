<!-- Provide a summary/statement below -->
Metrist contributes the second part of his Pollen EP trilogy to Timedance. This instalment sees the producer up the intensity of his sound to a fever pitch. Brash synths, sub drops and bold edits combine to make an evil concoction. His singular production aesthetic showcases meticulous and forceful sound design, but all the time keeps a sense of humour like no one else.
