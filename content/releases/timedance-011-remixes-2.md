<!-- Provide a summary/statement below -->
Timedance drops a second instalment of remixes, featuring two interpretations of the Ploy track "Footprints In Solid Rock", taken from last years Iron Lungs EP.Beatrice Dillon contributes first with a sublime, dubbed out trip. She strips back the percussion of the original and adds a single dreamlike chord, it's a real zoner. Peder Mannerfelt supplies the flip. The remix takes on a stomping yet minimal form, before dissolving into one of the most wigged out uber-rave breakdowns, designed for the late night sessions!â€‹
