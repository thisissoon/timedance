<!-- Provide a summary/statement below -->
Four years on from his release on TIMEDANCE002 as L.SAE, Joseph Higgins is back on the label under his flagship moniker Metrist. 

Pollen Pt. I is the first part of a trilogy of records, showcasing Metrist's latest developments in twisted beat-science. The release combines four tracks of rudeboi electro swagger, off-kilter vocal chops and imaginative grooves. 

Since his L.SAE record in 2015 Metrist has released on Where To Now?, Neighborhood and an LP Opal Tapes, here he refines his sound palette even further, striking a unique balance between the avant-garde and dancefloor.
