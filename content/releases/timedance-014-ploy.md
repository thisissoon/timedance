<!-- Provide a summary/statement below -->
Ploy returns for his third solo Timedance record, the 14th release on the label. The London producer is in absolute banger mode for this one, finding his stride with these frenetic gunfinga-ready assaults, both as fun and playful as they are playful and rude. artwork by Danielle Doobay.
