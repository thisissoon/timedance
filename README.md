### Releases

Do not save for web

## Compress

Download [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac "ImageOptim")

Important: Before using ImageOptim, make a copy of the original (uncompressed) .jpg. Once you run ImageOptim, the file will be overwritten. I suggest keeping two folders â€“ *Uncompressed* images and *Compressed* images.

Example:
