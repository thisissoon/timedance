##Compress

Download [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac "ImageOptim")

Important: Before using ImageOptim, make a copy of the original (uncompressed) .jpg. Once you run ImageOptim, the file will be overwritten. I suggest keeping two folders – *Uncompressed* images and *Compressed* images.

Example: 
![Image folders](https://github.com/thisissoon/timedance/blob/master/static/reference/image-folders.png "Image folders")


###Settings

⋅⋅* Quality: Enable lossy minification
⋅⋅* JPEG quality: 80%
⋅⋅* Optimisation level: Extra

Example:
