Once you are happy and you've checked there are no mistakes, go to your post on GitHub and click edit. Change 'draft = true' to read 'draft = false'. Commit this change. This will publish your new release/event.

## Step 07

Wait a few minutes for the site to regenerate and your new post to appear.

## Troubleshooting

If your post doesn't appear, check your [Commits](https://github.com/thisissoon/timedance/commits/master "Commit history"). It will likely be a formatting issue e.g. a missing comma.

# Image guidelines

Save each image using the following guidelines

### Releases 
* Width: 900px 
* Height: 900px
* Resolution: 72dpi
* File format: .jpg

*Do not 'save for web'*

### Events
* Width: 900px

## Compress

Download: [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac "ImageOptim")

Important: Before using ImageOptim, make a copy of the original (uncompressed) .jpg. Once you run ImageOptim, the file will be overwritten. I suggest keeping two folders â€“ *Uncompressed* images and *Compressed* images.
