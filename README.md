# Image guidelines

Save each image using the following guidelines

### Releases 
* Width: 900px 
* Height: 900px
* Resolution: 72dpi
* File format: .jpg
* Colour setting: sRGB

*Do not save for web*

### Events
* Width: 900px 
* Height: 1273px
* Resolution: 72dpi
* File format: .jpg
* Colour setting: sRGB

## Compress

Download: [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac "ImageOptim")

Important: Before using ImageOptim, make a copy of the original (uncompressed) .jpg. Once you run ImageOptim, the file will be overwritten. I suggest keeping two folders â€“ *Uncompressed* images and *Compressed* images.

Example: 
![Image folders](https://github.com/thisissoon/timedance/blob/master/static/images/instructions/image-folders.jpg "Image folders")


### Settings

* Quality: Enable lossy minification
* JPEG quality: 80%
* Optimisation level: Extra

Example: 
![ImageOptim preferences](https://github.com/thisissoon/timedance/blob/master/static/images/instructions/image-optim-preferences.jpg "Image folders")
